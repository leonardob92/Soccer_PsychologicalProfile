ABSTRACT
Soccer is arguably the most widely followed sport worldwide, offering great opportunities to investigate the psychological profile of the few elite players who succeed despite the stiff competition. While previous research reported high-level executive functions in elite soccer players, a comprehensive psychological profile remains elusive. In this study, we examined a cohort of 328 participants, comprising 204 elite soccer players from Brazil and Sweden. Employing a range of metrics, we evaluated participants' personality traits and cognitive abilities. Elite players demonstrate heightened executive functions, alongside enhanced planning and memory capacities. They exhibit elevated levels of Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Openness to Experience, coupled with reduced Neuroticism and Agreeableness. Employing artificial neural networks, we decoded soccer players from controls based on their psychological profiles. This research provides insights into the psychology of elite soccer players, holding significance for talent identification and development strategies in soccer and potentially other domains.
