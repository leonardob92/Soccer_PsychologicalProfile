ABSTRACT
Soccer is arguably the most widely followed sport worldwide, and many dream of
becoming soccer players. However, only a few manage to achieve this dream, which has
cast a significant spotlight on elite soccer players who possess exceptional skills to rise
above the rest. Originally, such attention was focused on their great physical abilities.
However, recently, a new perspective has emerged, suggesting that being an elite soccer
player requires a deep understanding of the game, rapid information processing, and
decision-
­ making. This growing attention has led to several studies suggesting higher
executive functions in soccer players compared to the general population. Unfortunately,
these studies often had small and nonelite samples, focusing mainly on executive func-
tions alone without employing advanced machine learning techniques. In this study,
we used artificial neural networks to comprehensively investigate the personality traits
and cognitive abilities of a sample of 328 participants, including 204 elite soccer players
from the top teams in Brazil and Sweden. Our findings indicate that elite soccer players
demonstrate heightened planning and memory capacities, enhanced executive func-
tions, especially cognitive flexibility, elevated levels of conscientiousness, extraversion,
and openness to experience, coupled with reduced neuroticism and agreeableness. This
research provides insights into the psychology of elite soccer players, holding signifi-
cance for talent identification, development strategies in soccer, and understanding the
psychological traits and cognitive abilities linked to success.
